## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a cloud developer building automation workflows and scalable solutions using Azure Functions and Logic Apps. This repository is a collection of projects, templates, and examples where I explore how to streamline processes, integrate services, and reduce manual tasks through serverless architecture.

My focus is on leveraging Azureâ€™s serverless offerings to build event-driven systems that are efficient, cost-effective, and easy to maintain. With Azure Functions, Iâ€™m creating lightweight backend logic that responds to events such as HTTP requests, queue messages, or scheduled triggers. These functions allow me to write clean, modular code that executes only when neededâ€”ideal for automation and microservice scenarios.

Alongside this, I use Logic Apps to visually design workflows that connect APIs, services, and data across platforms. Whether itâ€™s automating email alerts, syncing data between systems, or processing form submissions, Logic Apps makes it easier to orchestrate these tasks with minimal code.

This repository includes reusable function templates, sample workflows, and integration examples that demonstrate how to build reliable automation pipelines in the Azure ecosystem. I focus on real-world scenarios such as file processing, system monitoring, API integration, and business process automation.

As I continue to learn and build, Iâ€™m also exploring best practices around security, scalability, error handling, and cost optimization. My goal is to create cloud-native solutions that are both powerful and practical.

If you're working with Azure or interested in automation and serverless development, feel free to explore the projects, share feedback, or collaborate. Iâ€™m always open to learning and sharing ideas with the community.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and hereâ€™s to building smarter, automated systems, one function at a time.
